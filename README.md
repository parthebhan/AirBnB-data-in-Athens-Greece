    The prices of the top 20 listings with the highest reviews per month 

    The locations of the top 50 most expensive AirBnB listings in Athens, Greece

# Data visualization 

### Listings with more than 100 reviews, with the dates of each listing‚Äôs most recent customer review:

Data Visualization Type: Scatter Plot with Size and Color Encoding
        
Why:A scatter plot allows visualization of the listings based on the number of reviews (size) and the dates of most recent customer reviews (color), providing a clear overview of the listings with more than 100 reviews and their recent activity.

### Prices of the top 20 listings with the highest reviews per month:

Data Visualization Type: Bar Chart

 Why: A bar chart is effective in displaying the prices of the top 20 listings, making it easy to compare their values. Adding a color gradient to the bars can represent the reviews per month, providing additional information on popularity.

### Locations of the top 50 most expensive AirBnB listings in Athens, Greece:

Data Visualization Type: Map Visualization (Choropleth Map or Bubble Map)

Why: Mapping the locations of the top 50 most expensive listings on a map provides a geographical perspective, allowing stakeholders to identify concentration areas and make informed decisions about land development based on pricing trends in specific regions.
